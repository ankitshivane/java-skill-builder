# Java 9 Features
**Some of the important java 9 features are;**

1. Java 9 REPL (JShell)
2. Factory Methods for Immutable List, Set, Map and Map.Entry
3. Private methods in Interfaces
   * In Java 9 onwards we can write private methods in interfaces
   * this private can be static or non-static as well
   * As they are private they can be access only inside that particular interface
   * It brings advantages as
     * Reduce code duplication
     * improve code encapsulation by hiding implementation details
     * It helps us to share common between non-abstract methods of interfaces
   * Till JDK 7 we can have only abstract methods inside interfaces
   * In JDK 8 we can have abstract methods, default methods, static methods
   * in JDK 9 we can have private methods along with abstract methods, default methods, static methods
