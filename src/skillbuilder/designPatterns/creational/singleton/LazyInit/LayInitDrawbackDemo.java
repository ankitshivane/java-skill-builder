/**

 * Two times constructor got called, means multiple Threads multiple objects creation breaking the singleton.

 * Output:

 * Inside getInstance method called by Thread-0
 * Inside getInstance method called by Thread-1
 * Constructor called by Thread-0 thread.

/**
With synchronized keyword
as you can see below with synchronized keyword you can see constructor got called only one time.
getInstanceSync method called 2 times but only one object created.
OUTPUT:

Inside getInstance method called by Thread-1
Constructor called by Thread-1 thread.
Inside getInstance method called by Thread-0
