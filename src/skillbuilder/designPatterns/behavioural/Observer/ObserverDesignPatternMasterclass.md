# üìò Observer Design Pattern ‚Äî Masterclass

## ‚úÖ 1. Definition (Theory)

The Observer Design Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object (Subject) changes
state, all its dependents (Observers) are notified and updated automatically.

üéØ 2. Use Case Analogy

* Think of a YouTube Channel (Subject).
* Users subscribe to it (Observers).
* When the channel uploads a new video, all subscribers are notified.

üß† 3. Why Use It (Benefits)

* Promotes loose coupling between subject and observers.
* Useful in event-driven systems or GUI frameworks.
* Easily scalable ‚Äî add/remove observers at runtime.
* Easy to implement pub-sub behavior in monoliths or microservices.

üß± 4. Components

| Component            | Description                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Subject**          | Interface to attach/detach observers and notify them.     |
| **ConcreteSubject**  | Actual class that maintains state and notifies observers. |
| **Observer**         | Interface for objects that want to receive updates.       |
| **ConcreteObserver** | Class that implements the update logic.                   |

* [Refer Example](ObserverDemo.java)

üß™ 7. Interview Use Case

* We implemented Observer pattern in our appointment system to notify patients when a canceled slot became available. It
  helped in reducing wait time and improving user satisfaction. Each patient subscribed to a slot or specialty, and the
  observer mechanism pushed notifications via email or SMS when slots opened up.

‚ùó 8. Edge Cases / Gotchas

| Case                      | Impact                                                       |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Too many observers        | Performance issues during notify cycle                       |
| Memory leaks              | Observers not removed on detach ‚Üí leads to memory pressure   |
| Thread-safety             | If subject is shared across threads, ensure thread-safe list |
| Exception in one observer | Should not break the rest ‚Äî wrap in try-catch during notify  |

üß∞ 9. Real-World Scenarios

| Scenario              | Where Used                                        |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Event listeners in UI | Java Swing, JavaFX                                |
| Kafka consumers       | Microservices listen to events from Kafka topics  |
| Webhooks              | GitHub notifying Jenkins                          |
| Email/SMS alerts      | Notify customers when something important happens |
| Redis Pub/Sub         | Inter-service communication                       |

üîπ 10. Pull vs Push Models

| Model | Behavior                                                     | Example                          |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Push  | Subject sends all the data when notifying.                   | `update(String data)`            |
| Pull  | Subject notifies observers, and they query it for more info. | `update()` + `subject.getData()` |

üîπ 11. Variants & Enhancements

1. Async Notification:
    * You can make notify() async using threads/executors to avoid blocking.

2. Prioritized Observers:
    * Observers with a priority number ‚Äî executed in order.

3. Filtered Notification:
    * Notify only observers interested in certain event types.

4. Java 9 Flow API:
    * Reactive Streams-based built-in Publisher/Subscriber model.

üîπ 12. Common Interview Questions

| Question                                   | How to Answer                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| When would you use the Observer pattern?   | When you have multiple components that need to stay in sync with a central state (e.g., real-time notifications). |
| How does it support loose coupling?        | Subject exposes only an interface (`Observer`), not implementation details.                                       |
| Push vs Pull?                              | Push: subject sends data; Pull: observer fetches what it needs.                                                   |
| Difference between Event Bus and Observer? | Event Bus is a broader abstraction, often async and supports filtering/prioritization.                            |

üîπ 13. Advantages

* Loose coupling
* Dynamic subscription
* Promotes separation of concerns
* Scales well with event-driven architectures

üîπ 14. Disadvantages

* Memory leaks (if observers are not detached)
* Too many observers can cause performance issues
* Notification is often synchronous unless explicitly made async
